## Getting Started

After installation, you can start using ONNX Runtime in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to help you get started:

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

# Load the model
session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx")

# Prepare input data
input_data = ...  # Your input data here

# Run inference
output = session.run(None, {"input": input_data})

print(output)
```

## Usage

Using ONNX Runtime is straightforward. Here are some common tasks you can perform:

### Inference

To run inference with a pre-trained model, follow these steps:

1. Load your ONNX model.
2. Prepare the input data.
3. Call the `run` method to get predictions.

### Training

ONNX Runtime also supports training. To train a model:

1. Define your model architecture.
2. Use ONNX Runtime's training APIs.
3. Monitor training progress and save your model.

### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance:

- Use the latest version of ONNX Runtime.
- Ensure that your hardware accelerators are properly configured.
- Profile your model to identify bottlenecks.
